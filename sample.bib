abstract="As the form factors of computational devices diversify, the concept of eyes-free interaction is becoming increasingly relevant: it is no longer hard to imagine use scenarios in which screens are inappropriate. However, there is currently little consensus about this term. It is regularly employed in different contexts and with different intents. One key consequence of this multiplicity of meanings is a lack of easily accessible insights into how to best build an eyes-free system. This paper seeks to address this issue by thoroughly reviewing the literature, proposing a concise definition and presenting a set of design principles. The application of these principles is then elaborated through a case study of the design of an eyes-free motion input system for a wearable device.",
